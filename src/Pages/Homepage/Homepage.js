          <h3>Thesis:</h3>
          <p>
          Buddhism is an amazing philosophy full of wisdom with great truths, however I believe Buddhists have lost the way of the Buddha and lack a real basis of impact. Effective Buddhism is a solution to those who seek to follow the Buddhist Path as Buddha Wanted. If Buddha was alive today, imagine the amount of change and impact he would be having.

          <h3>Evidence:</h3>
          <p>
          In current Buddhist society, the top Buddhist role models have iron wills, but lack real ACTION or PURPOSE behind this because of a misinterpretation of Dharma. Buddha’s four main vows tell a different story of how the Buddha should act.

        <div className='point-sec'>
            <p>The Bodhisattva Vows exist in many different forms; they are chanted as follows:The Bodhisattva Vows exist in many different forms; they are chanted as follows:</p>
            <h3>1. Creations are numberless, I vow to free them.</h3>
            <h3>2. Delusions are inexhaustible, I vow to transform them.</h3>
            <h3>3. Reality is boundless, I vow to perceive it.</h3>
            <h3>4. The awakened way is unsurpassable, I vow to embody it.</h3>
        </div>
        <div className='point-sec'>
            <p>It’s also said in this way.</p>
            <h3>1. Living beings are limitless, I vow to liberate them all.</h3>
            <h3>2. Blind passions are limitless, I vow to sever them all.</h3>
            <h3>3. Dharma gates are inexhaustible, I vow to know them all.</h3>
            <h3>4. Unsurpassed is awakening, I vow to realize it.</h3>
        </div>
        <div className='point-sec'>
            <p>Or, in the most laymen terms:</p>
            <h3>1. To save all people</h3>
            <h3>2. To renounce all worldly desires</h3>
            <h3>3. To learn all teachings</h3>
            <h3>4. To attain perfect enlightenment</h3>
        </div>
        <div className='description'>
          <p>
          If you go searching, there are many other ways these four vows are written, but they are all telling the same thing, in this order.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className='description'>
          <p>
          As anyone may observe from the outside, the most influential people in the world today are not Buddhists. On top of that anyone from a Non-Buddhist city, will tell you that they have not heard from a Buddhist about why that path is best.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className='description'>
          <p>
          It is a sickness is the Buddha communities today to ignore the first vow, and try to move on to 2,3, and 4. By the very means of the vows, step 2 cannot be done without first completing step 1. Step 1 is in fact, an earthly desire. The Four Main Vows are a harmonious right of passage that must be balanced in action towards their completion.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className='description'>
          <p>
          Therefore, the way of the Buddha should be to renounce all worldly desires IN ORDER TO save all people, and to learn all teachings IN ORDER TO save all people, and that once these steps are completed perfect enlightenment will be attained. This means that these tasks are in harmony. As one renounces more wordy desires to spend more time saving people, one learns teachings to improve how they go about saving others, and rides the collective path towards enlightenment.

          <h3>Reiterating The Message:</h3>
          <p>
          Many buddhists today practice the seeking of enlightenment rather than practicing the way of Buddha himself. Buddha was an enlightened being who spread his philosophy far and wide, preaching and changing and influencing the world and his actions live on to this day.

            <h5>Four truths, Four Vows</h5>
            <p>The another series of discussion of ideas stephen batchelor has been presenting in dharma talks since last 2010.You can hear them at dharmaseed.org. One of the attractive ideas to come out of stephen Batchelor's rwcwnt teaching is a mapping of the four Noble Truth onto the four Bodhisttva Vows of the Zen traditional a concept batchelor got from former Zen priest and current Vipassana.</p>
